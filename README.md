# osu!droid Benchmarks
An unofficial osu!droid project made by me, where you see some phones with fps submitted through my google form (it's in the link on the contents on the second header)

If you want to see the preview of this project, please [click here](https://paytouse.github.io/osudroid-benchmarks/index.html)

# Submitting Scores
Wanted to see your phone model in the website? Please submit your very own score by [clicking here](https://forms.gle/1vbqbEbiLirCobmC6)
